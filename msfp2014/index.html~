<h1>Mathematically Structured Functional Programming 2014</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">functionality from structure</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The fifth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of
remarkable power and abstraction.  Where would Haskell be without
monads?  Functional reactive programming without
arrows?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions?   The list goes on.  This workshop is a forum for
researchers who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and
control.

<h2>Abstracts of Invited Talks</h2>

Bob Atkey's talk <br>
  <b>Applications of Relational Parametricity beyond Type
Abstraction</b> <p>


John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields "free" theorems about programs just from their types. The range of applications of relational parametricity is dazzling: including data type representations, non-inhabitation results, and program optimisation. <p>

I will talk about recent work that has extended Reynolds' theory beyond invariance under changes of data type representation to other kinds of invariants. Quantifying over geometrical transformations allows for free theorems for programs that manipulate geometric data, capturing geometric invariance properties. Likewise, quantifying over distances yields free theorems capturing continuity properties. The range of applications of generalised relational parametricity is equally promising: for example, geometric free theorems can be connected to classical mechanics and Noether's theorem to yield physical conservation laws directly from types. <p>

Shin-ya Katsumata's talk <br>
 <b>Logical Relations for Monads by Categorical TT-Lifting</b> <p>


Logical relations are widely used to study various properties of typed lambda calculi. By extending them to the lambda calculus with monadic types, we can gain understanding of the properties on functional programming languages with computational effects. Among various constructions of logical relations for monads, I will talk about a categorical TT-lifting, which is a semantic analogue of Lindley and Stark's leapfrog method. <p>

After reviewing some fundamental properties of the categorical TT-lifting, we apply it to the problem of relating two monadic semantics of a call-by-value functional programming language with computational effects. This kind of problem has been considered in various forms: for example, the relationship between monadic style and continuation passing style representations of call-by-value programs was studied around '90s. We give a set of sufficient conditions to solve the problem of relating two monadic semantics affirmatively. These conditions are applicable to a wide range of such problems. If time permits, I will also talk about a variant of this result, namely a generic soundness for the effect systems over effect monoids. <p>
