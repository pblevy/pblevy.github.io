    <h2>Effects and Call-By-Push-Value</h2> 
<h4><a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl">Paul Blain Levy</a>, University of Birmingham</h4>

    <p>This course is an introduction to call-by-push-value, a fine-grained
calculus that subsumes both call-by-value and call-by-name
lambda-calculus with computational effects (imperative features).</p>
<p>
After introducing the language, and the translations from call-by-value
and call-by-name, we'll learn both operational and denotational
semantics for a variety of effects: exceptions, I/O, state and control
(continuations).
</p>

<p>
This course is aimed at students with knowledge of typed
      lambda-calculus.  I encourage students to read my <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/mgsall.pdf">course notes on
      typed lambda-calculus</a>, at least up to Section 14, before the
      course.  I will recap in the first lecture but rather quickly.

<p>Here are the 
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/mgsfastlam.pdf">
course slides</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/mgsadvexx.pdf">some exercises</a>.</p>
