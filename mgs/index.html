    <h2>Accommodation</h2>

    <p>A number of (non en-suite) rooms have been reserved in <A
    href="http://www.conferences.bham.ac.uk/vac-accom/chamberlain.htm">Chamberlain
    Hall</A>. The costs are £25 for bed and breakfast. You have to
    book the accommodation together with your registration, and rooms
    will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

    <h2>How to get here</h2>

    <p>The University is adjacent to the "University" rail station,
    which is served by frequent local trains from the main station
    "Birmingham New Street". While it is a very short distance to the
    lecture rooms from University station, walking to Chamberlain Hall
    is perhaps too far if you have to carry luggage as well. We
    recommend that you take a taxi from "New Street" to <B>Shackleton
    Hall</B> when you first arrive. This is right next to Chamberlain
    and the place where you will receive the key for your room. It is
    also where everyone can meet from 7pm onwards for a buffet dinner
    on Sunday evening. If you arrive by plane to Birmingham
    International Airport, then it is best to take the train to New
    Street and then a taxi. More travel information and maps can be
    found <a href="http://www.location.bham.ac.uk/">here</a>.</p>
 
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p>These will take place in G33, Aston Webb building. For the
    parallel sessions in the afternoon we have additionally reserved
    WG5 and WG12, also in Aston Webb.</p>

    <h2>Food and drink</h2>
 
    <p>The coffee served during breaks is included in the registration
    fee. Lunches are not included, but there are several food outlets
    located on campus.</p>
   
    <h2>Computer use</h2>

    <p>There will be guest accounts to access the web and to use ssh
    for logging into your home machines.</p>

    <h2>Costs</h2>

    <p>Apart from the accommodation costs, there is a small fee of £40
      to cover local expenses. If you wish to take advantage of the
      accommodation in Chamberlain Hall, then you must pay in advance,
      either by credit card or by cheque. See the registration section
      for details.
      </p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>

    <p> For registration, please do <b>two things:</b> Send an email
      to P.B.Levy at cs.bham.ac.uk. This is primarily to take note of
      your email address, as all further information will be sent out
      electronically.   <br> Secondly, print and fill in the <a
      href="regform.pdf">registration and accommodation reservation
      form</a> and either post it to <p>
Mrs S Snow<br>
School of Computer Science<br>
University of Birmingham<br>
Edgbaston<br>
Birmingham<br>
B15 2TT<br>
United Kingdom<p>
including a cheque (made payable to the University of Birmingham) or credit card number, or fax it to +44 121 414 5370 including a credit card number. The fax machine is
      in a secure location and only accessible to office staff. Do not
      send credit card details via email.<br> Rooms in Chamberlain
      Hall will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

     <h2>Grants</h2>
    
     <p>The Midlands Graduate School is supported by a grant from
     EPSRC. Only graduate students based in the UK are eligible for a
     grant. We will pay out moneys <b>after</b> the school, so
     <b>everyone</b> has to pay their registration fee (and
     accommodation costs) up-front. We will strive to use the money
     available to maximize participation in the School and for this
     reason cannot guarantee full reimbursement to anyone.</p>
