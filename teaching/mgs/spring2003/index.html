    <h2>Semantics of Effects</h2><br>

We start with simply typed lambda-calculus, with function types, sum types and product types.  We look at beta and eta-laws for these types, discuss reversible derivations and the most general "positive" and "negative" connectives (this is Girard's terminology).

<p>

  We add, one at a time, 3 computational effects: 
<ul>
<li> divergence (and recursion)
<li> printing
<li> storage, in a single global storage cell
</ul>
We describe the <b>call-by-value</b> and <b>call-by-name</b> evaluation strategies, and discuss possible definitions of observational equivalence.  Thus we have 6 languages.

<p>

We carefully establish denotational semantics for each of these 6 languages, proving soundness in each case.  For call-by-value, we look at the <b>fine-grain call-by-value</b> language which simplifies the semantics.  For call-by-name, we move from carrier semantics (suitable for divergence) to algebra semantics (suitable for printing) to behaviour semantics (suitable for storage).

<p>

We arrange these semantics in a table and spot the pattern: it is evident that there is a single language underlying call-by-value and call-by-name.  This language is <b>call-by-push-value</b>, and we discuss its basic properties.
